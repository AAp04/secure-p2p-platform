# Secure Peer-to-Peer Networking Platform

This project is a secure peer-to-peer networking platform that demonstrates the principles of secure software design, including encryption, traffic logging, and user authentication.

## Features
- **End-to-End Encryption:** All communication is encrypted using TLS.
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Logs incoming connections and suspicious activities.
- **User Authentication:** OAuth2-based user authentication (placeholder implementation).
- **Scalable Design:** Built using GoLang for high performance and reliability.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** GoLang
- **Encryption:** TLS using Go's `crypto/tls` package
- **Logging:** Traffic logs stored in `traffic.log`
- **Authentication:** OAuth2 (implementation placeholder)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/aap04/secure-p2p-platform.git
   cd secure-p2p-platform

Generate TLS Certificates (Replace server.crt and server.key):
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes

Run the server:
go run main.go

Connect a client: Use tools like telnet or build a Go client to test connections:
telnet localhost 8443
